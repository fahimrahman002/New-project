# RenameFilesUsingCpp
File renaming is so boring and time consuming. If you start to rename files one-by-one it will take hours for many files(imagine 100000!!).
So insteed of renaming files manually it is a good practice to keep our machine running and have a cup of coffee or ice-cream.
Just need to edit some code in 'Rename file.cpp' and run it.
